# Interview Coding Base

Welcome!

We're so excited to see where this can lead. In front of you is a basic project related to what we do, generating and managing contracts worth millions. However, don't worry, this is extremly simplified and your task will be limited. We'll happily guide you through the real system after passing the interviews.

By now you should have received instructions on what to achieve. Remember that this assignment is intended to be short, so if you get stuck, don't be afraid to ask questions.

### Prerequisites for running

- NodeJS 16+

### Instructions
1. Clone repository
2. Setup a new private repository with the source code
3. Run `npm run dev` (will start both frontend and backend)
4. Write your code
5. Push your solution to a new branch
6. Create a Pull Request when your ready and reach out to us for setting up the interview

## FAQ
#### How will I be evaluated?
You bring in your solution and get to walk it through with us. We use this as a starting point to have discussion. We want to understand your reasoning and depth of knowledge. As a rule the discussion is more important than the actual code. Also no one is an expert at everything so this also helps us understand your strengths as well as areas of improvement across the stack.

Some of the things we will look at in the evaluation:
- **Code quality** - How you reason about making sure code is readable and maintainable.
- **Testing** - How you reason about what to test and how to test it.
- **Performance** - How you can identify performance bottlenecks and reason around solving them.
- **System design** - How you reason about concepts like reusability, separation of concerns and various abstractions.
- **Infrastructure and operations** - How you would run a system and what's important to think about.

In this we also try to understand how you solve problems generally and how you communicate your solutions. Problem solving and communication are both things we value highly.

#### Why did you pick this stack?
This is the stack that the majority of our platform is written in. However, parts have been reduced to bare minimum to open up for discussions. We definitely don't require you to be an expert in this stack and we are more interested in your knowledge of building web applications in general.

#### Can I change things in the existing code?
Yes please! We would love to hear what you think are some of the things that we can do better.

#### Can I use additional libraries/frameworks?
You're free to use whatever you want. The important thing is that you can explain why you made the decision. We would recommend sticking to the basic stack however (React + NodeJS).
